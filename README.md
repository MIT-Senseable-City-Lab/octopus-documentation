# Installation

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Requirements
- Node.js version 18.0 or above (which can be checked by running node -v). You can use nvm for managing multiple Node versions on a single machine installed.
- When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

### Local development
Make sure to clone the repo if you want to run it locally. 

```
$ cd octopus-documentation
$ npm run start
```
This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

By default, a browser window will open at `http://localhost:3000`.
