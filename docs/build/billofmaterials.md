# ðŸ“¦ Bill Of Materials

---

Below, we provide you with the full list of physical components that are compatible with the Octopus. These can be divided in three parts: how to prepare and order the PCB, other hardware electronics and sensors, and materials for the bodyframe.

Note that all links provided are examples we know will work to build the Octopus, but it does not exclude other providers of manufacturers.

### PCB

The costum PCB can be set up to ways: 
1. Order the board from a manufacturing company and ask them to pre-solder the components for you. 
2. Order the board and all small hardware components separately, and solder it by hand. *Note, this requires you to know how to solder small components.*

In any case, you can find all the Gerberfiles, schematics and BOM files needed to order and solder the Octopus PCB: https://github.com/MIT-Senseable-City-Lab/octopus-fabrication/tree/main/hardware

*See [PCB](../build/electronics.md) for more information on how to set it up.*


### Hardware components

| SD Card | SD card to store collected data (List from Amazon). | [link](https://www.amazon.com/micro-sd-card/s?k=micro+sd+card) |

### Bodyframe components

Components you need to order to build the body frame:

| **Bodyframe** | **Type** | **Comment** | **URL** |
|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Filament |  White PLA or PETG | For 3D printing the Octopus, make sure the filament you order works with your printer! | [link](https://eu.store.bambulab.com/nl-nl/collections/pla/products/pla-basic-filament) |

**Note**: To attatch the bodyframe to other surfaces you need to buy other components. Possible attatchments can be anything with a basic gopro mount (like a tripod), rubberbands, magnets, or strings.
