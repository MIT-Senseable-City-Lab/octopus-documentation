The core of the octopus is fabricability, modularity and 'deploy everywhere'.

:::tip[⚙️ Fabricability]

*Ability to be formed or shaped; capable of being constructed or manufactured*

:::

:::tip[🧩 Modularity]

*The degree to which a system's components may be separated and recombined, often with the benefit of flexibility and variety in use.*

:::

:::tip[🌎 Deploy everywhere]

*The ability of being deployed in a fixed or mobile deployment on a variety of surfaces*

# 3 setup examples

The Octopus is developed for three use cases in mind with different skill requirements. But before diving into the use cases, make sure to build an Octopus!

:::info

All the different Use Cases can be found in the [Run](../category/run/) folder. But before running the use cases, make sure [build your Octopus device](../category/build). 

:::


1. [Temperature Exposure](../run/case1.md) (easy).
2. [Air quality Monitoring](../run/case2.md) (medium). 
3. [Flower (Image) Classification](../run/case3.md) (hard).
