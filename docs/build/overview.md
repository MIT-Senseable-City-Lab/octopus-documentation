# 🏔️ Overview

---

*What if we could empower communities to monitor their environment by making fabrication processes accessible for all, fostering a maker-centric approach?*

---


The core principles of octopus are: fabricability, modularity and 'deploy everywhere'.

:::tip[⚙️ Fabricability]

*Ability to be formed or shaped; capable of being constructed or manufactured*

:::

:::tip[🧩 Modularity]

*The degree to which a system's components may be separated and recombined, often with the benefit of flexibility and variety in use.*

:::

:::tip[🌎 Deploy everywhere]

*The ability of being deployed in a fixed or mobile deployment on a variety of surfaces*

# Three sample projects

The Octopus is developed for three use cases in mind with different skill requirements. 

:::info

Use cases can be found in the [Run](../category/run/) folder. But before running the use cases, make sure [build your Octopus device](../category/build) first. 

:::


1. [Temperature Exposure](../run/case1.md) (easy).
2. [Air quality Monitoring](../run/case2.md) (medium). 
3. [Flower (Image) Classification](../run/case3.md) (hard).
