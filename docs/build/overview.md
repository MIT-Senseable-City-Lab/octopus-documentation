# 3 setup examples

The Octopus is developed for three use cases in mind with different skill requirements. But before diving into the use cases, make sure to build an octopus!

:::info

All the different Use Cases can be found in the [Run](../category/run/) folder. But before running the use cases, make sure [build your octopus device](../category/build). 

:::


1. [Temperature Exposure](../run/case1.md) (easy).
2. [Air quality Monitoring](../run/case2.md) (medium). 
3. [Flower (Image) Classification](../run/case3.md) (hard).
